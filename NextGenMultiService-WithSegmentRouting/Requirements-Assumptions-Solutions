Requirements
Provide Bandwith visibility
Ensure Bandwith from top(R) network follows a specific botton(B) network path
Avoid traffic getting rerouted on bottom network when link goes down.  Example of this is when you have multiple services on a PE and and you want to utilize a single link but multiple links exist.  If that links goes down, you don't want traffic to reroute to the second link.
Bandwith On Demand for service
Be able to utilize existing hardware

Solutions
Built MPLS Segment Routing over the Bottom Network
Services are going to use Segment Routing colors for SR-policy
